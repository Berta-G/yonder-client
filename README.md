Phone app for Уonder!
================

This iphone app was my final project at Makers Academy. 
Together with Andrey Krahmal ([@plawtr]) we built Yonnder! in 10 very intentse days full of coding.

##Technologies:
- The app is built using Phonegap framework together with Ionic for styling.
- It is written in Haml and Coffeescript (and compiled into HTML and Javascript).
- Handlebars are used to produce the different templates.
- It comunicates with the server ([scuper]) through JQuery requests getting and posting JSON data.
- Provides directions by accessing Google maps API.

##Plugins:
- geolocation 
- file-transfer
- phonegapspinner
- socialsharing
