Phone app for Уonder!
================

This iOS app was my final project at [Makers Academy]. 
Together with Andrey Krahmal ([@plawtr]) we built Уonder! in 10 intense days of coding.

##Technologies:
- The app is built using Phonegap/Cordova framework. 
- The app utilises Ionic framework for styling.
- It is written in Haml and Coffeescript (and compiled into HTML and Javascript).
- Handlebars are used to produce and compile page templates.
- It comunicates with the server ([scupr]) through JQuery requests getting and posting JSON data.
- It accesses phone's GPS functionality.
- Provides directions by accessing Google Maps API JavaScript.
- It incorporates Stripe API for payments inside the app.
- Integrates with iOS passbook and generates Store and Loyalty Cards

##Phonegap/Cordova Apache and Third Party Plugins:
- geolocation 
- camera
- file
- dialogs
- file-transfer
- phonegapspinner
- socialsharing
